# ✅ Next Step: Deploy Your Project

## What You See Now
✅ You're on the Environment Variables page
✅ It shows "No Environment Variables Added" - this is GOOD!
✅ The broken environment variable is gone

## Now Do This:

### STEP 1: Go to Deployments
1. Look at the **top navigation bar** (Overview, Deployments, Analytics, etc.)
2. Click on **"Deployments"** tab

### STEP 2: Find Latest Deployment
1. You'll see a list of deployments
2. Look for the most recent one (at the top)
3. It might show an error or "Failed" status

### STEP 3: Redeploy
**Option A: Redeploy Existing**
- Click the **three dots (⋯)** next to the latest deployment
- Click **"Redeploy"**
- Wait 1-2 minutes

**Option B: Trigger New Deployment (If no deployments exist)**
- Click the **three dots (⋯)** next to your project name at the top
- Click **"Redeploy"** or go to **Settings → Git → Redeploy**

### STEP 4: Watch It Build
1. Click on the deployment to see build logs
2. Watch for any errors
3. If it succeeds, you'll see a green checkmark ✅
4. Your site URL will appear (e.g., `physio-3s3a.vercel.app`)

Send me a screenshot of the error message from the build logs, and I'll help fix it!
